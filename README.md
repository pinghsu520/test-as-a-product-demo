# Test as a Product - Demo
This is a demo project intended to show how Test as a Product and the [Bridge Service](https://github.com/adobe/bridgeService) can work. In this project we show how testBridge works.

We have the following parts:
* **my-blog** : A ReactJS project.
* **my-blog-backend** : A nodeJS-based micro-service.
* **e2e-tests/backend-tests** : A Java Project dedicated to testing the my-blog-backend apis.

## Demo Deployment
In this chapter we help you start the demo project.

### Requirements
For the project to work you need the following:
* Git access
* Java >= 11
* Node >= 16
* Maven and access to an artefactory


This project has been tested with the node versions:
* `v20.7.0`
* `v18.16.1`
* `v16.17.0` (Better avoid)

and Java versions:
* Java 18
* Java 11
* Java 8 (Will work just to get the project working. But to finish the demo you will need at least Java 11)


### Deployment Order
There is a rough deployment order to get this project running:
1. Start the Back End
2. Testing the Back End
3. Start the my-blog app
4. Testing the front end

#### 1. Starting the Back-End
To start the backend :
1. Go to the directory `my-blog-backend`.
2. Install the dependencies `npm i`
3. Press `npm run dev`

Now you can test the system by running backend tests.

#### 2. Testing the Back-End
To run the backend tests:
1. go to project `e2e-tests/backend-tests/`
2. Run tests by entering `mvn clean test`

#### 3. Starting the Front-End
To start the front-end application:
1. Go to the directory `my-blog`.
2. Install the dependencies `npm i`
3. Press `npm run start`

Now you can test the system by running backend tests. But you can see that it is running with the url http://localhost:3000/.

#### 4. Front-end tests
In order to start the cypress tests:
1. go to project `e2e-tests/frontend-tests/fe-tests-cypress`
2. Install the dependencies `npm i`
3. `npm run cy:run`. Other simply open cypress for manually assited running `npx cypress open`.

### Known Issues

### Issues with Cypress
#### Local Issues
As this section is a Cypress project, we need to install the necessary dependencies [Cypress Dependencies](https://on.cypress.io/required-dependencies).

#### Issues on CodeSpaces

##### Xvfb
While running the project on CodeSpace you will encounter issues related to Xvfb.

```Shell
Your system is missing the dependency: Xvfb

Install Xvfb and run Cypress again.
```

In such cases you can simply install it by running the following from the CodeSpaces terminal:

```Shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xvfb

```
